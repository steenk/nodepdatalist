# No Dependency Datalist

Most modern browsers support the HTML5 datalist, but not Safari, yet. This is a datalist polyfill without dependencies to libraries like Modernizr and jQuery. Just add the script file, and it will check for the existence of datalist support in the browser, and if that is abcent (Safari), it will implement it self.
